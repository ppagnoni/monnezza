spec:
  project: default    # Projects provide a logical grouping of applications, which is useful when Argo CD is used by multiple teams
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/ppagnoni/monnezza.git # we are using a public repo, we can use both ssh or https
    targetRevision: HEAD  # we can use git brnaches or tags and also regx expressions
                          # in case of it should point to the chart version
    path: "ArgoCD Tutorial for Beginners: GitOps CD for Kubernetes n1/01_example"
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc   # this is the api-server service!!!

    # The destination is useful when you use a single argocd instance to deploy applications to multiple clusters. 
    # In our case, we'll deploy the app to the same Kubernetes cluster where argocd is running, so we need to provide a path to the local Kubernetes api server. 
    # That's the bare minimum that we need to get started with argocd.

  syncPolicy:   # manages the synchronization of applications deployed in a Kubernetes environment with their corresponding configurations stored in a Git repository. 
    automated:
      prune: true   # By default (and as a safety mechanism), automated sync will not delete resources when Argo CD detects the resource is no longer defined in Git
      selfHeal: true   # automatically sync differences in the live cluster state and the Git-defined state (git is source of truth)
